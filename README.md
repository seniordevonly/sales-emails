## Local server for development

Please note that it's possible to use your IDE's preview functionality to open the HTML file and work with it.

HTML file could be opened manually in your browser as well.

In case local server is needed do the following steps:
1) Install dependencies with command `npm i` run in the project root directory;
2) Run local server with command `npm run start`. The browser tab will be opened and reloaded after applying changes to file.
